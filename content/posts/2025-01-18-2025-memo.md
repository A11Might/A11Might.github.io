> My one tip is to use the tech stack you are most familiar with; don’t get lost in the frameworks rabbit hole. People don’t care what stack you’ve used to build it. Keep building!

> My first try used Cursor, and let it edit everything.

Redowan 在博客上记录日常，比如做的事、读的书和看的演讲，还加了评论或引用。这样一方面在年终回顾时有成就感，另外定期写东西也能督促自己去多做、多读。文章最后也说了这个方案足够简单、有效，看着满满的记录很满足。当然，别写自己都不愿意看的东西。
