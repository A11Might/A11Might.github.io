You can’t expect your friends to root for you if you don’t root for them. Here’s how you can do that:\n\u003e - Be quick to praise: Train your first instinct to praise. \n\u003e - Be tactfully honest: Good people value constructive criticism deeply. \n\u003e - Expand their vision – “That’s awesome… and imagine if you… and have you seen this…?”\n\u003e - Signal‑Boost – Shares and like their stuff all the time and ask them to tell you when they post.\n朋友飞轮\n#2025",
